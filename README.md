# **Pokemon Trivia Maze** 
**VERSION 1.0** \
Created by: AJ Downey, Kenneth Ahrens, and Katelyn Malone \
Spring 2021

**What is this project?:** \
This is a fan-made-non-profit project made entirely in Java, Java Swing GUI, and
uses an SQLDatabase. The idea for this trivia game is based on the "Who's that Pokemon?"
segment from the original Pokemon anime. We all played Pokemon so we
thought this would be a fun project for fans to test their knowledge.
The objective is to move through the maze by answering "Who's that Pokemon?" and reach the end goal.
There is currently support for all Pokemon up to Generation 7 (Sun/Moon),
so 800+ encounterable pokemon can be quized on. There is a multiple choice
or user input gamemode. Music, difficulty and generation can all be customized
through the menubar! Gamestate can also be saved/loaded.
